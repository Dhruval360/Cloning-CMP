Observations made: 
1) When a single file name is entered after cmp command in the shell, it never terminates if -n is not given. Hence I have handled this case by 
   prompting the user to enter the byte limit. 
2) When -n is entered multiple times it takes the least number of bytes.
3) When -i is entered multiple times it takes the largest individual skip values.
4) When a number is entered without being preceded by an option like -n or -i it is taken as skip initial byte value for the first file.

Known Bugs:
1) I couldn't understand what '--' alone signifies for cmp as sometimes I found that it just ignores it. So this hasn't been implemented properly.
2) Maximum bytes value gets capped at largest 64 bit number with no way of identifying any number larger than that to throw appropriate warning.
3) When a single filename is entered and when text input is taken from the user for comparison, if the user enters a large amount of byte limit, 
   segmentation fault could occur.

Yet to be implemented:
1) Take in numbers in any format other than base 10. (cmp supports octal, binary and hexadecimal byte value input as well).
2) Check for directories. (When a directory is entered in place of a filename, cmp can spot that and tells the user that itâ€™s a directory).
3) Alignment of output in some cases.
4) KiB, GiB, etc. notations couldn't be added. (However the notations stated in the man page have been implemented).

Note: All outputs (including the help page and the version have been copied directly from the output screen) 

Now, the actual cmp in LINUX has a number of options and they are as follows:
 	
       -b, --print-bytes
              print differing bytes

       -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP
              skip first SKIP bytes of both inputs

       -i, --ignore-initial=SKIP1:SKIP2
              skip first SKIP1 bytes of FILE1 and first SKIP2 bytes of FILE2

       -l, --verbose
              output byte numbers and differing byte values

       -n, --bytes=LIMIT
              compare at most LIMIT bytes

       -s, --quiet, --silent
              suppress all normal output

       --help display this help and exit

       -v, --version
              output version information and exit
